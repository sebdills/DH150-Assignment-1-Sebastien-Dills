## Heuristics Evaluations of Depop.com and Etsy.com - Sebastien Dills, Digital Humanities 150 Assignment 1                                  

## Depop.com

1. Depop is a digital marketplace that advertises itself on being a sustainable way to buy used and vintage clothes online. It is primary a mobile app but also has a website that offer the same core functionalities of buying and selling clothes. 
    1. https://www.depop.com
    2. The app is very solid but is restricted to mobile use. If you want to shop on Depop via a computer you are restricted by a very limited website that offers way less than the app version. The reason for this is unclear, but it almost seems as if the website is geared to push you towards using the app. This however restricts 60 percent of e-commerce that still happens via a laptop or desktop computer. The only method by which to find cloths is a limited search bar. In addition to this there is no catered content and the indivudal user is bascially expected to do most of the work of finding products using basic search functionality.

### Visibility of system status
Keeping users informed about what is going on. Each action should have an indication giving either an error or confirmation that the intended action is happening. 
 
 
##### Evaluation
Once you arrive on the site it is unclear if you can even buy anything there, it prompts you to download the app despite the fact that you are on a computer and the app is only available via mobile. There is no reason for this to prompt you to download the app if you aren’t on mobile. Extremely poor login process. When making a new account asks for a phone number as the first step but requires use of email to recover the password. Errors are confusing and unclear on how to recover login info if forgotten. Prompted with “An unknown error has occurred” when entering login info from mobile account. I also came into several issues with the website recognizing an account made via mobile using my apple ID. It is almost as if the website is pushing you away from computer use in favor of the app on mobile. 
 
### Match between system and the real world
Make terms/phrases used on the system accessible, intuitive and simple. Match digital systems to real life ones so users can pick up how the interface works quickly and easily. 

##### Evaluation
This site is unlike most others in terms of its basic functionality. No explore function (beyond a set of default results below search bar), no items are highlighted, no filters or categories. Part of this is because of Depop’s use of independent sellers, but there is no reason why they can’t have sellers select several categories to fit items into (brand, size etc) and then categories using dropdown menus like any other ecommerce fashion website. Icons used are standard, letter icon to share, heart to like, tab to save. 
 
### User control and freedom
Give the user control over the system, errors should be easy to fix/go back to a earlier step. Steps should flow nicey, intuitivly and quickly. Actions should not have needless steps. 
 
##### Evaluation
Once you’ve given the platform your sizes, brands you are interested in, and other fashion interests you are allowed to update this manually but finding this can be extremely confusing as it is not setting tab where you would expect it. In addition to this once you search for an item and look through the results, if you click on a specific piece and then want to go back to their original search results there is not option within the website to do so. Instead you need to click on the back arrow on your web browser. This forces you to reload the page and brings you back to the top of the search results (so you need to continue to scroll and find where you were on your own). There is also no cart function on this website, you must order each item one at a time and completely refill the same information multiple times. While is may be due to the fact that items are sold from independent sellers, this is no excuse as Depop has laid off the extra effort of communicating buyer information to multiple seller to the users of their website.

### Consistency and standards
Consistent verbage should be used. Actions/interface should mimick standard practices in order to make platform easy to naviage. Different actions/options should be distiguishable and clear. 
 
##### Evaluation
Only offers shopping via a “search” bar. Offers no ability to filter searches; by price, sizes, sex, brand, etc. No dropdown menu to sort items. Extremely different platform and much limited functionality compared to app. App caters your feed given information you give it and allows for way more filter/functionality than website. Is confusing and frustrating to use website that is so inferior to the app in every way. There is no reason to not offer same functionality on computers as there is on mobile. Some people might like shopping on computers more. 
 
### Error prevention
Clear and helpful comments to correct errors and logical action steps to make it difficult to have an error to begin with.  Restrict uneeded or pointless actions. 
 
##### Evaluation
There was little to no error prevention. Nothing allowed me to recover my old account using my phone number. When you try to make a new account the first thing it asks for is a phone number and it won’t let you proceed if your number is already tied to an account. If you try to make a new account but you already have one the only piece of information you have is which phone number is tied to your account, but you cannot use the same phone number to recover your username or password. Also the user cannot use phone number in place of email or username at time of login.  
 
### Recognition rather than recall
Information should be accessibel on all steps of a set of actions. Hints and guidance should be offered when making choices. Labled and icons used when appropriate. 
 
##### Evaluation
Especially through the lens of an older shopper who would likely feel more comfortable shopping on a computer over a mobile devise, the inconsistencies from the app to the website are extremely frustrating. The entire sight does not feel like it actually sells anything at first and doesn’t resemble the app in any way. This discrepancy might make even recognizing the website as the same as Depop difficult. 
 
### Flexibility and efficiency of use
Actions should be quick and easy for users who are experienced and unexprienced with your system. Shortcuts offered to make experiecned users progress though actions quickly, but not requried so that novice users can still understand what is going on. 
 
##### Evaluation
The lack of search filters makes it extremely difficult to speed up looking for something specific. The use of hashtags and the ability to follow accounts you like does help this a little, but this requires a great deal of time spent and familiarity with/on the platform. Hashtags for an item of clothing are chosen by sellers. This allows for a great deal of inconsistencies and makes the use of hashtags an inadequate replacement for search filters. Lack of a cart adds needless steps to a user who knows what they are looking for. It is easier for an experienced user to find items based on accounts they choose to follow or postings they have liked or saved. 
 
### Aesthetic and minimalist design
Limit needless text and information. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 
 
##### Evaluation
The design is quiet minimalist and easy to navigate given the functionality of the website. 

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Expressed in simple language. Give clear instructions on how to fix issue. Indicate course of action. 
 
##### Evaluation
 Errors are confusing and unclear on how to recover login info if forgotten. Prompted with “An unknown error has occurred” when entering login info from mobile account. This is unhelpful and offers the user no course of action to remedy the issue. This error was given when logging into an existing account tied to an Apple ID account on mobile. You can’t recover your account using your phone number which would be the easiest considering most users have multiple emails and just a single phone number. You also cannot login using your phone number. 
 
 
### Help and documentation
If documentation is needed should be simple and clear for users to find.
 
##### Evaluation
Although there are a few points where Depop goes wrong where other e-retailers are not in terms of design. The website is simple enough to not require any documentation. Selling on the website is marginally more complicated but, in this case, adequate documentation is provided. 
 
## Etsy.com

1. Etsy is also a digital marketplace but it carries far more products than just used clothes. You can buy art, jewlery and craft supplies. It also has a mobile app but Etsy is more focused on 
    1. https://www.etsy.com
    2. The website is much better than depop due to the fact that it offers simple categorization and filters. It's crowded interface, inconsistent implementation and uninspring choice of words make the site difficult to navigate.
