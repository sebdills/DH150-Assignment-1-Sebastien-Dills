## Heuristics Evaluations of Depop.com and Etsy.com - Sebastien Dills, Digital Humanities 150 Assignment 1                                  

## Depop.com

1. Depop is a digital marketplace that advertises itself on being a sustainable way to buy used and vintage clothes online. It is primarily a mobile app but also has a website that offers the same core functionalities of buying and selling clothes. 
    1. https://www.depop.com
    2. The app is very solid but is restricted to mobile use. If you want to shop on Depop via a computer you are restricted by a very limited website that offers way less than the app version. The reason for this is unclear, but it almost seems as if the website is geared to push you towards using the app. This however restricts 60 percent of e-commerce that still happens via a laptop or desktop computer. The only method by which to find clothes is a limited search bar. In addition to this there is no catered content and the individual user is basically expected to do most of the work of finding products using basic search functionality.

### Visibility of system status
Keeping users informed about what is going on. Each action should have an indication giving either an error or confirmation that the intended action is happening. 
 
##### Evaluation
Once you arrive on the site it is unclear if you can even buy anything there, it prompts you to download the app despite the fact that you are on a computer and the app is only available via mobile. There is no reason for this to prompt you to download the app if you aren’t on mobile. Extremely poor login process. When making a new account asks for a phone number as the first step but requires use of email to recover the password. Errors are confusing and unclear on how to recover login info if forgotten. Prompted with “An unknown error has occurred” when entering login info from mobile account. I also came into several issues with the website recognizing an account made via mobile using my apple ID. It is almost as if the website is pushing you away from computer use in favor of the app on mobile. 
 
### Match between system and the real world
Make terms/phrases used on the system accessible, intuitive and simple. Match digital systems to real life ones so users can pick up how the interface works quickly and easily. 

##### Evaluation
This site is unlike most others in terms of its basic functionality. No explore function (beyond a set of default results below search bar), no items are highlighted, no filters or categories. Part of this is because of Depop’s use of independent sellers, but there is no reason why they can’t have sellers select several categories to fit items into (brand, size etc) and then categories using dropdown menus like any other ecommerce fashion website. Icons used are standard, letter icon to share, heart to like, tab to save. 
 
### User control and freedom
Give the user control over the system, errors should be easy to fix/go back to an earlier step. Steps should flow nicey, intuitively and quickly. Actions should not have needless steps. 
 
##### Evaluation
Once you’ve given the platform your sizes, brands you are interested in, and other fashion interests you are allowed to update this manually but finding this can be extremely confusing as it is not setting a tab where you would expect it. In addition to this, once you search for an item and look through the results, if you click on a specific piece and then want to go back to their original search results there is no option within the website to do so. Instead you need to click on the back arrow on your web browser. This forces you to reload the page and brings you back to the top of the search results (so you need to continue to scroll and find where you were on your own). There is also no cart function on this website, you must order each item one at a time and completely refill the same information multiple times. While it may be due to the fact that items are sold from independent sellers, this is no excuse as Depop has laid off the extra effort of communicating buyer information to multiple sellers to the users of their website.

### Consistency and standards
Consistent verbiage should be used. Actions/interface should mimic standard practices in order to make the platform easy to navigate. Different actions/options should be distinguishable and clear. 
 
##### Evaluation
Only offers shopping via a “search” bar. Offers no ability to filter searches; by price, sizes, sex, brand, etc. No dropdown menu to sort items. Extremely different platform and much limited functionality compared to apps. App caters your feed given information you give it and allows for way more filter/functionality than website. Is confusing and frustrating to use a website that is so inferior to the app in every way. There is no reason to not offer the same functionality on computers as there is on mobile. Some people might like shopping on computers more. 
 
### Error prevention
Clear and helpful comments to correct errors and logical action steps to make it difficult to have an error to begin with.  Restrict unneeded or pointless actions. 
 
##### Evaluation
There was little to no error prevention. Nothing allowed me to recover my old account using my phone number. When you try to make a new account the first thing it asks for is a phone number and it won’t let you proceed if your number is already tied to an account. If you try to make a new account but you already have one the only piece of information you have is which phone number is tied to your account, but you cannot use the same phone number to recover your username or password. Also the user cannot use phone number in place of email or username at time of login.  
 
### Recognition rather than recall
Information should be accessible on all steps of a set of actions. Hints and guidance should be offered when making choices. Labeled and icons used when appropriate. 
 
##### Evaluation
Especially through the lens of an older shopper who would likely feel more comfortable shopping on a computer over a mobile device, the inconsistencies from the app to the website are extremely frustrating. The entire sight does not feel like it actually sells anything at first and doesn’t resemble the app in any way. This discrepancy might make even recognizing the website as the same as Depop difficult. 
 
### Flexibility and efficiency of use
Actions should be quick and easy for users who are experienced and inexperienced with your system. Shortcuts offered to make experienced users progress through actions quickly, but not required so that novice users can still understand what is going on. 
 
##### Evaluation
The lack of search filters makes it extremely difficult to speed up looking for something specific. The use of hashtags and the ability to follow accounts you like does help this a little, but this requires a great deal of time spent and familiarity with/on the platform. Hashtags for an item of clothing are chosen by sellers. This allows for a great deal of inconsistencies and makes the use of hashtags an inadequate replacement for search filters. Lack of a cart adds needless steps to a user who knows what they are looking for. It is easier for an experienced user to find items based on accounts they choose to follow or postings they have liked or saved. 
 
### Aesthetic and minimalist design
Limit needless text, information and visuals. Place points of action in logical areas in proximity of other similar options. 
 
##### Evaluation
The design is quite minimalist and easy to navigate given the functionality of the website. 

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Expressed in simple language. Give clear instructions on how to fix the issue. Indicate course of action. 
 
##### Evaluation
 Errors are confusing and unclear on how to recover login info if forgotten. Prompted with “An unknown error has occurred” when entering login info from mobile account. This is unhelpful and offers the user no course of action to remedy the issue. This error was given when logging into an existing account tied to an Apple ID account on mobile. You can’t recover your account using your phone number which would be the easiest considering most users have multiple emails and just a single phone number. You also cannot login using your phone number. 
 
 
### Help and documentation
If documentation is needed should be simple and clear for users to find. Documentation should provide needed additional info and troubleshooting for common errors. Also provide means of communication to whoever runs the system. 
 
##### Evaluation
Although there are a few points where Depop goes wrong where other e-retailers are not in terms of design. The website is simple enough to not require any documentation. Selling on the website is marginally more complicated but, in this case, adequate documentation is provided. 
 
## Etsy.com

1. Etsy is also a digital marketplace but it carries far more products than just used clothes. You can buy art, jewelry and craft supplies. It also has a mobile app but Etsy is more focused on 
    1. https://www.etsy.com
    2. The website is much better than depop due to the fact that it offers simple categorization and filters. It's crowded interface, inconsistent implementation and uninspiring choice of words make the site difficult to navigate. 
    
### Visibility of system status
Keeping users informed about what is going on. Each action should have an indication giving either an error or confirmation that the intended action is happening. 
 
##### Evaluation
The homepage is very crowded with different pictures. The response of each image when you hover over it with your mouse is different. Some show a small tab indicating price some simply show some slight movement to indicate your computer recognizes you are pointing at something. This inconsistency might make it difficult to keep track of what you are looking at. In addition, some images are links to blog posts so these also have a different animation when interacted with. At the top of the screen there are several dropdown menus for standard categories: clothes, shoes, jewelry etc. There is an additional “Holiday Shop” that isn’t differentiated from any of the other stylistically, however when you put your mouse over it, no dropdown menu is there. This makes it very difficult to know what the selection will offer you, especially when the term “Holiday Shop” is already quite vague. 
 
### Match between system and the real world
Make terms/phrases used on the system accessible, intuitive and simple. Match digital systems to real life ones so users can pick up how the interface works quickly and easily. 

##### Evaluation
Terms used aren’t very consistent. Phrases like “top categories” and “top trends” are difficult to differentiate and don’t necessarily have a clear meaning. Having a “Holiday Shop” section is also confusing as it doesn’t have a dropdown menu to show what kinds of products are in that section. In order to like something there is an intuitive heart icon. The gifts section is notated by a gift box icon. “Updates” is marked by a bell. These are clear intuitive choices that represent their function well. 
 
### User control and freedom
Give the user control over the system, errors should be easy to fix/go back to an earlier step. Steps should flow nicey, intuitively and quickly. Actions should not have needless steps. 
 
##### Evaluation
Upon selecting a lot of the images of certain products you are brought to an intermediary screen with another image and description of the product. Below that (occupying most of the screen) is dozens of pictures of similar items. Instead of this the item itself that you wanted to see should be highlighted fully. In order to see sizes, prices and additional info/pictures you need to once again click on the item at this intermediary step. It is also unclear if certain images indicated actual products or are simply stock images leading you to similar looking products. Also sometimes when selecting an item upon searching for it, it opens a new tab without your consultation. In other similar circumstances this does not happen. 

### Consistency and standards
Consistent verbiage should be used. Actions/interface should mimic standard practices in order to make the platform easy to navigate. Different actions/options should be distinguishable and clear. 
 
##### Evaluation
The home page offers tons of variety of pictures. The way they are organized is very confusing however. Some categories are “top trend”, “our selections”,  “editors’ picks” and “our categories”. Additionally there are “suggested searches”, “recently viewed” and “top categories”. It is very unclear for example how “top categories” and “top trends” is different or how “our selections” and “editors’ picks” are different. These inconsistencies and redundant categories make the website feel cluttered and difficult to navigate. At the top of the page there are additional categories including clothing, jewelry, holiday shop etc. These categories are also somehow differentiated from the others. It is unclear what the relationships between all of these are. 
 
### Error prevention
Clear and helpful comments to correct errors and logical action steps to make it difficult to have an error to begin with.  Restrict unneeded or pointless actions. 
 
##### Evaluation
Errors are generally well covered. All the basic functionalities are properly implemented to the point where errors or mistakes are likely not common. 
 
### Recognition rather than recall
Information should be accessible on all steps of a set of actions. Hints and guidance should be offered when making choices. Labeled and icons used when appropriate. 
 
##### Evaluation
When progressing through a series of selections the terms and images used are often very inconsistent. For example if you select the “Holiday” option at the top of the screen it is unclear what kinds of items you will find.  In order to save items there is an intuitive heart icon. The gifts section is notated by a gift box icon. “Updates” is marked by a bell. Examples of clear intuitive choices that represent their function well. 
 
### Flexibility and efficiency of use
Actions should be quick and easy for users who are experienced and inexperienced with your system. Shortcuts offered to make experienced users progress through actions quickly, but not required so that novice users can still understand what is going on. 
 
##### Evaluation
Once you click on the “Holiday Shop” tab it brings you to another page with 4 discernible options. The names of these are extremely unclear. One is simply titled “Boo”. There are also tons of pictures with no clear connection to each other. There is no reason why there shouldn’t be a drop down menu for each of the 4 main choices presented to the user of the system. These should also have more descriptive names so that the user can more quickly see what kinds of items are under that section. 
 
### Aesthetic and minimalist design
Limit needless text, information and visuals. Place points of action in logical areas in proximity of other similar options. 
 
##### Evaluation
The website is cluttered with unneeded information and redundant images. Categories need to be more intuitive and clear. It is difficult to tell where you are and oftentimes what you are looking at. 

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Expressed in simple language. Give clear instructions on how to fix the issue. Indicate course of action. 
 
##### Evaluation
Again not a major issue. A common error might be accidentally selecting a wrong icon. This is easily fixed with the back button.  
 
### Help and documentation
If documentation is needed should be simple and clear for users to find. Documentation should provide needed additional info and troubleshooting for common errors. Also provide means of communication to whoever runs the system. 
 
##### Evaluation
There is a help center found at the bottom of the screen. It offers a bunch of articles on common issues and offers a search bar to ask specific questions. This covers most foreseeable issues.
